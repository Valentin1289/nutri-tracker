### Technologies used:

MongoDB is a database that helpt us to easily store all the objects and datas we need to be stored. React, a popular web application library, was chosen for its effectiveness in creating interactive and dynamic UI components. We utilized Bootstrap and Victory for impressive and responsive styling, along with custom CSS.Day.js helped in manipulating better dates for a good managing of how eated products are stored for each day. Also Email-validator offered us an official and good verification of the emails that users are using.
